# Hangman-the-game
A short game made using Pygame library in python

# Intro
I created this game in Python 3, using Python's pygame library. This was a semester project, so i had to create the whole game without any aid of a game making software. and in itself, the pygame library is not very good for creating games so a lot had to be manually created from scratch.
